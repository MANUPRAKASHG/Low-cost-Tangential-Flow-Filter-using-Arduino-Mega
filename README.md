# Low-cost-Tangential-Flow-Filter-using-Arduino-Mega

Abstract :-
The main aim of the project is to design a Low cost Tangential Flow Filter. Where the tangential flow filter that filters sults from the liquid flow using membrane but to get the requred concetration A specific pressure flow is required so to sense the pressure we used Pendotech pressure sensors and to auto correct the Pressure we used Stepper motor with a header.

Here we only disscus about control system for this TFF( Tangential Flow Filter). By controling the RPM(Rotation Per Minute) of the stepper motor the liquid pressure is  controlled then  we used a Nextion HMI display to set the liquid pressure directly in it then a paticular RPM  of stepper is automatically set according to get that pressure.

Key words :- Nextion HMI display, RPM, Pressure sensors

I did this with technical support with Nagabushanam sir, Jithendra sir and with finally support with Paravathula sir. 
In supervision of Dr Laxminarayana sir.
