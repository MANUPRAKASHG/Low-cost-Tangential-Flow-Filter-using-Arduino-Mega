Low cost Tangential Flow Filter using Arduino Mega
Abstract :-
The main aim of the project is to design a Low cost Tangential Flow Filter. Where the tangential flow filter that filters salts from the liquid flow using membrane but to get the required concentration A specific pressure flow is required so to sense the pressure we used Pendotech pressure sensors and to auto correct the Pressure we used Stepper motor with a header.

The control system for this TFF. So, by controlling the RPM(Rotation Per Minute) of the stepper motor the liquid pressure is  controlled then  we used a Nextion HMI display to set the liquid pressure directly in it then a particular RPM  of stepper is automatically set according to that pressure.

Key words :- Nextion HMI display, RPM, Pressure sensors


I did this with technical support from Nagabushanam sir, Jithendra sir and financial support with Bharata Ratnam sir. In supervision of Dr Laxminarayana sir.
